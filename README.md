# Terraform_Architecture_With-_AWS
Here we would try to understand the architecture of AWS Services using Terraform
This repository demonstrates the implementation of scalable and resilient architectures on AWS using Terraform. The infrastructure is defined as code, allowing for easy deployment, management, and version control.

## Project Overview

This project aims to showcase the following AWS architectures:

- 2-Tier Architecture: A two-tier architecture with a web tier and database tier. It includes EC2 instances, load balancers, and RDS instances.

- 3-Tier Architecture: A three-tier architecture with a web tier, application tier, and database tier. It includes EC2 instances, auto scaling groups, load balancers, and RDS instances.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `/2-Tier-Architecture`: Contains the Terraform code for the 2-tier architecture.


## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following:

- An AWS account with appropriate permissions.
- Terraform installed on your local machine.
